Building and Running
---

There are a few targets `all`, `clean`, `test`,  `dump` and the final output is a couple of binaries - the main output is a suite of Catch test cases, which should all pass when we say `make clean all test`  

There is also a travis CI build at https://travis-ci.org/patrickmmartin/2.8284271247461900976033774484194
